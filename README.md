# EDDAI-EliteDangerousApiInterface
a web API capable of providing processed and stored data from EDDN

## Project Description

EDDAI-EliteDangerousApiInterface is a web API designed to provide processed and stored data from EDDN (Elite Dangerous Data Network). This project allows users to easily access up-to-date and detailed information about the Elite Dangerous universe. The system is still in alpha and there will be major updates in the coming year. Currently, there is no official online version of the EDDAI system.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The API collects data from EDDN, a network that distributes real-time information from Elite Dangerous players.
2. **Data Processing**: The collected data is processed to ensure it is accurate and useful for end users.
3. **Data Access**: Users can access the data through API endpoints, which provide structured and easy-to-use information.

This API is an essential tool for Elite Dangerous players who want to stay updated on the latest events and changes in the game.

EDDN is not run by or affiliated with the developer of the game - Frontier Developments.
